SmallPHPMVC
=============

This is a small MVC framework I've been using on personal projects for a while. It 
was based on a write-your-own-MVC-framework tutorial used to be here 
(http://www.phpit.net/article/simple-mvc-php5/), but that link is dead now.

I'd consider this code "beta" so use at your own risk, but there isn't much code here so 
if something breaks, just fix it! :)

TODO: Make router HTTP Request Method - aware to allow for RESTful routing.
